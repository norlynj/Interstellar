 <br />Interstellar is an out of this world quiz game full of history, theory, and programming mysteries. Developed using Java, Interstellar utilizes the swing GUI framework.
It implements the concepts, theories, applications, and principles about programming paradigms. This project was developed for our CMSC13 class.
## Game Rules and Mechanics ##
  * The user can choose what questions to answer, either theoretical or programming
  questions
  * The user has the option to primarily randomize the said theoretical questions or start
  from a specific type of topic from the list below
    * Introduction to programming paradigms
    * Procedural Programming
    * Functional Programming
    * Object-oriented Programming
    * Event-driven Programming
    * Imperative vs Declarative Programming
    * Design Patterns
  * Similarly, the user has the option to randomize the programming questions or start
  from a specific type of language from the list below
    * Java
    * C
    * Python
    * Javascript

### Scoring and Rewards
  * Each quiz session/level has 10 questions each
  * There will be five rounds, which means that there are 5 ships to save, namely;
  Blackbird, Quinjet, Sanctuary 2, Benatar, and Milano.
  * If the user scores at least 6/10 then the ship is saved. He/she can choose whether to
  move to the next level to save another ship or go back to the main menu to start again.
  * If the user scores less than 6, then he/she has failed to save the ship and will be
  redirected to the menu.
  * The user will gain the “guardian of the galaxy” title when he/she have passed 5
  consecutive rounds.
